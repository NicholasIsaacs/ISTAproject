## Intro
My names is Nicholas Isaacs, and I have a minimal level of knowledge when it comes to programming. The 
various applications that I have ideas for are all conceptually mobile applications with the potential to be carried over to computers for one aspect or another. Mobile app development is a sincere area of interest for me. 

## Idea 1 
The first and most prominent idea for a software application I have is a mobile app that would allow the user to make a customized workout plan that includes their dog. In today's fast paced environment, it's hard enough to get to the gym for our own work out needs, let alone schedule time for our loyal companions to get the exercise they need to stay healthy. To do this I would like to create a profile for the user that details their own individual fitness needs and goals, as well as the recommended exercise the user's dog would need. This could be done by drawing information from a database that consists of different breeds, ages, and weights and the recommended exercise given those details, and obviously general health information regarding the user. I would like the app to have push notification capabilities that would let the user know when it's time for a scheduled workout. This application would have elements of a database GUI and an organization system. I also see room to add to the app in the form of group meet ups, and a tinder like feature to match breeders and/or dog enthusiasts. The goal being to make a complete mobile doggy hub. 

My objectives with this app would be to acquire a greater knowledge of how to link databases and use the information entered to generate an 'answer' for the user. Going over the various forms of data tables gave me a basic understanding of how the data could be linked, but I would like to see how the data could be used to generate something completely new based on something that already exists. On top of that I would like a greater understanding of how code is executed at a predetermined time to deliver a notification. 

## Idea 2	
My next idea would be a physics based strategy game that would be carried out in a 2D format. Each player would control a character. Though the characters might look different, they will all posses the same load-out and abilities. The goal would be to score hits on the enemy player(s), and after a set amount of 'hits', the player's character would thus be defeated resulting in a victory or loss for either player. Hits will be scored by throwing various objects at the enemy, all of which follow different physical trends, causing different flight paths. The sport would be in the players ability to read the trajectories of various items, dodge them, and consequently be able to throw the same objects accurately to score a hit. I would also incorporate various RNG mechanics such as ''critical hits' and other mechanics such as immunity for a short duration.

My biggest objective with this application would be to understand object oriented physics, and how code determines movement. Right now we have a very basic understanding of how to manipulate code, and I would like to be able to connect moving objects to code. My second objective would be understanding how multiple moving objects on a screen are coded, how their properties interact with each other and how to evoke a response out of an object using another one. I would also like to learn more about RNG objects and variables.

## Idea 3
My third app idea would be a preventative measure against drunk driving. The app would be linked to your credit/debit card, and would have the capability to deactivate the card for a short duration of time once a drinking limit and/or spending limit has been met. This could be achieved through various methods, one of which being a facilitator version of the app for bars, so users could connect through local wifi, cell service or bluetooth. They would be given a customer ID and the bar could tally their drinks. I would also like to set up the capability to open an account with the app that the user could deposit funds in. When their limit has been reached, they can get a push notification asking if they would like to contact an uber/lyft or other form of transportation service for a ride home.

There's a lot of learning objectives I have when it comes to this app. How to update information in the moment and deliver it to a user. How to make two different versions of an app that have different functions but still speak with each other. In a coding perspective I would like to understand how connectivity between devices work and how they access networks and acquire signals. 

## Conclusion

I Think App 1 or 2 is what I'm most passionate about, I'm an avid gamer and my love for my dog is the only thing that parallels that interest. I would love to see what direction I could take either one of those, but with our current understanding of coding I feel more comfortable with App 1 as of right now.
