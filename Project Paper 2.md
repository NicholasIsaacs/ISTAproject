# Project Paper #2 
## Nicholas Isaacs
### August 20th, 2018


My name is Nicholas Isaacs and I'm new to programming. The project I have chosen is a mobile app that helps people get themselves and their dogs the exercise they need. Many dog owners have very busy lives, lives that don't afford them the luxury to stay in shape let alone get their dog the proper amount of exercise. Myself being a busy dog owner, I understand the guilt we feel when we don't get the chance to take our dog out to play, and if we do maybe it's at the cost of the gym or a workout. It never seems like there's an occasion where all parties are satisfied, at least not one that occurs often. I hope to make a mobile app that bridges this gap by bringing tailored exercises that incorporate your dog, to the palm of your hand. 

My vision for this app incorporates a GUI, joining databases, and a scheduling feature that includes reminders. My main goal is to understand each of these aspects individually in a way that allows me to bring them together cohesively. I would like to go beyond understanding how to code individual elements and learn how to make a complete application.

I believe the data aspect of this project will be the most grueling. I need tons of information across the board including health information for both humans and dogs. This would include a matching set of data tables that include recommended workout information for both dogs and humans. For humans, I would like to be able to tailor it to weight, fitness goals, and time. I would like to reference public information made available my medical experts to achieve this. For dogs, I would like to reference the expert opinions of Vet professionals on recommended exercise for dogs of varying breeds, ages, and weights. When the user starts the app they would be asked to input their baseline information, and based off these data tables, a tailored workout plan would be generated that suits, both dog and owner, and could be completed in a set time. I do believe this is a stretch within the realm of my own personal capabilities, so at the least I would be able to pull information from both of these tables for a recommendation of how much exercise the dog and the owner individually need rather than a complete workout plan. I would also need to create data tables for the user's log-in information.

With the knowledge of programming I have now, this app seems like a challenge. I would have to create a GUI that displays all of the information I talked about above, and I would have to join several data tables to generate a workout plan for the user. I'm also unsure of how to program push notifications. This is a feature I would really like to incorporate so that people wouldn't have to remember on their own, the workouts the app schedules. There's a lot of programming that would go into the user's first experience with the app. There would be multiple interfaces that would request information from them, the retrieval of information from the databases regarding the workout plan, generating the workout plan, and delivering it to the user. I would like to think that the app would be relatively self sustaining after the information has been made, aside from push notifications to remind them of their workout, or if they want to log-in to view the workout, they would really only need to open the app to update fitness levels and goals.

I would like to keep the GUI simple. A log-in screen with a box for username and password, and a password reset function. Upon logging in the user would see their profile and customized workout plan displayed, with one or two buttons consisting of settings functionality and the option to update their plan. The next interface would be a screen that asks for all of the user's and dog's information. Once again I would like to keep this simple, with a few text-entry boxes for the user's name and the dog's name. I would like most of the boxes to function as drop down menus so that the information they select will be guaranteed to be available in the data tables. I believe this would make it easier in case of typos or other user errors. In short I would like to keep the GUI as simple as I can so that the focus will be on the data and programming aspects of the application. 

With maintaining a simple, easy to use GUI, I'm hoping that will allow me to focus most of my time on building the necessary data tables and functions of the app effectively. There's a lot of reference information that needs to be put in the app. I'm hoping by pooling information together I'll be able to minimize the amount of data entry I'll need to do. And by that I mean categorizing big breeds of dogs together, and making weight classes for both humans and animals. I'll also need to find a way to join these tables to create a workout plan the produces information relevant to both the human and the dog. That being said there will need to be a database for exercises as well that would need to have time sensitive, as well as weight parameters for individual exercises so that the program knows how to filter the information. The plan of attack is to gather all the necessary information, create the data tables, write the programming and create the GUI last.
